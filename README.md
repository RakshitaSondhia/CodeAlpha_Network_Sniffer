# CodeAlpha_Network_Sniffer
A network sniffer in Python that captures and analyzes network traffic.
This is a simple network sniffer that captures and prints details of each packet like source IP, destination IP etc.
Once the script is running, it will display traffic passing through your selected network interface. Each packet's source and destination IP, port numbers, and protocol (TCP, UDP, or other) will be printed.
